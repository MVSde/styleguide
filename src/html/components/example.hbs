{{#extend "layouts/components"}}
{{#content "body"}}

  {{#embed "layouts/article" title="Documentation file for a component" description="You can wrap components or variations thereof in awesome boxes with headings and descriptions."}}
  {{#content "body"}}
    <p>You can write your component in this file. But it is recommended to build elements as includes for greater reusability of your code.</p>

    <p>Includes will be loaded from the <code>src/html/partials</code> folder:</p>
    {{> "includes/example"}}
  {{/content}}
  {{/embed}}

  {{#embed "layouts/article" title="A variation of this component" description="This can have a description aswell."}}
  {{#content "body"}}
    <p>For better file organization you can add a namespace to your includes:</p>
    {{> "includes/namespace.example" }}
  {{/content}}
  {{/embed}}

{{/content}}
{{/extend}}
