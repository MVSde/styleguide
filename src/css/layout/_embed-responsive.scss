/**
 * EMBED RESPONSIVE
 *
 * For use with media embeds – such as videos, slideshows,
 * or even images – that need to retain a specific aspect
 * ratio but adapt to the width of their containing element.
 *
 * Default aspect ratio is 1:1. Change this by applying
 * modifier classes.
 *
 * The aspect-ratio hack is applied to an empty element
 * because it allows the component to respect `max-height`.
 *
